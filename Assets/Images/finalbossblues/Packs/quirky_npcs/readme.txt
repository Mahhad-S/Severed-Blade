   QUIRKY NPC CHARACTER SPRITE PACK

---------------------------------------

This is a collection of weird and quirky character sprites, designed to populate your game world with memorable NPCs!

All of these sprites are designed with at least one unique animation. Some of them have a simple bouncey idle, 
and others are more complex with multiple animations. 

A few of them also include full four-directional walking sprites, so they can have a more active role in your game.

---------------------------------------

Here's a list of all of the strange characters included in this collection:

- The Aeronaut
- The Sumo Wrestler
- The Snake Charmer
- The Snake
- The Woman in a Shoe
- The Cool Cat
- Definitely NOT Two Ducks in a Trenchcoat
- The Tunneler
- The Maestro

- The Space Traveler
- The Bush Man
- The Onion Boss
- The Two-Headed Twins
- The Man Under the Barrel

More info:

- Two color style variations: full-colored for general use, and a limited palette version to match my Time Fantasy style.
- No restrictions on use: OK for commercial projects, no engine limitations, no credit necessary.
- Includes sprite sheets formatted for RPG Maker VZ, Ace, MV and MZ!

The characters in this pack were originally created in a special month-long marathon event for my Patreon page! 
Throughout April of 2022, I released a new quirky character sprite every day.
