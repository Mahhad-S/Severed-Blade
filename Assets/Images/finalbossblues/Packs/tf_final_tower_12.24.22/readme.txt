Thank you for downloading this tileset! 

This set is a small expansion for the Time Fantasy RPG assets. 
It's compatible with all other graphics that I release in my Time Fantasy style. 
Can also be used as a standalone tileset.

Included are a number of animated tiles in the "character set" format. If you
are using RPG Maker, you will want to add a "!" to the beginning of these file names
so that the chara-sheet will align with the tile-grid.

If you are not using RPG Maker, the entire contents of the pack are on the single
sheet file ("complete.png"), which includes the all of the tiles and the animations.

There are two color variations inclued in this package: the "TF color" sheets
use a color scheme that will fit with the colors of my classic Time Fantasy assets.
The "full color" sheets are designed for general use with other assets, or with my
new Time Elements series.

This pack includes versions formatted for use in RPGMaker VX/Ace and RPGMaker MV/MZ, 
as well as a regular tile-sheet based on a 16x16 grid.

**Bonus**: I added an extra sheet with tiles for the World Map. These are arranged as an
add-on sheet: tiles arranged in a simple 16x16 grid so you can easily add them to
your world map tileset.

-------------------------

Personal Note:

This is planned to be the final expansion set released for the Time Fantasy style.

Of course, I will continue to support the classic style with regular releases 
to fill requests on my Patreon page.

Going forward, I will be working on a new series of assets. The first set of "Time Elements" 
has already been released. My art has improved a lot in the eight years (wow!) since I published
the original TF set-- and I am looking forward to releasing new content that better makes
use of my current ability level. You can think of the new Elements series as a sequel and 
upgrade to Time Fantasy.

I hope that my assets can help with your future projects too!

Thank you!
